# Currency Converter

This is a simple Python program that converts currencies using ExchangeRatesAPI. It asks for the base currency, target currency, and amount to convert, and then it prints the converted amount.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries using `pip install requests`.
2. Obtain an API key from [ExchangeRatesAPI](https://exchangeratesapi.io/).
3. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key in the Python file.
4. Run the Python file using the Python interpreter.
5. Enter the base currency, target currency, and amount to convert.
6. The program will print the converted amount.

## Enhancements

Here are some enhancements you can make to the program:

- Add error handling for invalid inputs.
- Display a list of available currencies.
- Add a GUI interface using Tkinter or PyQt.
