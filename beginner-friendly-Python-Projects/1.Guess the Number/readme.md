# Guess the Number Game

This is a simple "Guess the Number" game written in Python. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess what it is. The game provides feedback on each guess (e.g. "Too low!" or "Too high!"), and keeps track of the number of guesses it takes to guess the number.

## How to Play
To play the game, simply run the `guess_the_number.py` script in your Python environment. The game will generate a random number between 1 and 100, and prompt you to enter your guess. Enter your guess and press Enter. The game will tell you whether your guess was too high or too low, and prompt you to enter another guess. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number, and the game will tell you how many guesses it took.

Have fun!
